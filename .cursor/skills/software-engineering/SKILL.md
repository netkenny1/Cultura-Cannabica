# Software Engineering: Design, Architecture & Stack Guidance

## When to Apply This Skill

Use this skill when the user is:
- Designing or building websites, web apps, mobile apps, CRMs, or any software product
- Asking what is visually appealing, on-brand, or professional
- Choosing or comparing architectures, frameworks, or services (backend, hosting, auth, etc.)
- Seeking guidance on coding structure, stacks, or tooling

## 1. Visual Design & Human Appeal

**Principles that read as polished and intentional:**

- **Typography**: One clear hierarchy (one primary display/heading font, one body font). Prefer system fonts or established pairings (e.g. Inter + source serif, or a single variable font). Avoid more than two font families; avoid decorative or dated typefaces for body.
- **Spacing & rhythm**: Use a consistent scale (e.g. 4px or 8px base). Generous whitespace; avoid cramped layouts. Align to a grid; consistent padding/margins within components and between sections.
- **Color**: Limit palette (primary, secondary, neutrals, semantic success/warning/error). Ensure contrast for text (WCAG AA minimum). Prefer subtle backgrounds over busy patterns; use color to create hierarchy, not decoration.
- **Hierarchy**: Clear visual order—one main focal point per view, then clear secondary/tertiary. Use size, weight, and color to signal importance.
- **Consistency**: Same patterns for buttons, cards, forms, and navigation across the app. Reuse components; avoid one-off styles.
- **Motion**: Use sparingly (micro-interactions, loading, transitions). Prefer short (200–400ms), purposeful animation; avoid distracting or slow motion.

**Anti-patterns that feel unprofessional:** Cluttered layouts, too many fonts or colors, low-contrast text, inconsistent spacing, broken alignment, heavy gradients or drop shadows without purpose, autoplay or excessive animation.

For deeper patterns and examples, see [reference.md](reference.md#visual-design--ux-patterns).

## 2. Modern Branding & On-Brand Aesthetics

**What reads as current and professional today:**

- **Minimalism with intent**: Clean layouts, clear CTAs, enough whitespace. “Minimal” does not mean empty—every element should have a role.
- **Dark mode support**: Offer a dark theme (or system-preference follow) for apps and dashboards; use semantic color tokens so one palette drives both themes.
- **Authenticity**: Avoid generic stock-photo look. Use real imagery, illustration, or abstract visuals that fit the product; consistent tone in copy and visuals.
- **Accessibility as default**: Contrast, focus states, keyboard navigation, and semantic HTML are part of “on brand”—inclusive and professional.
- **Responsive-first**: Design for small screens first or in parallel; layouts and typography scale clearly across breakpoints.
- **Trust signals**: Clear navigation, contact/support, privacy/terms, and consistent identity (logo, favicon, meta) so the product feels legitimate.

**Context matters:** B2B/CRM/dashboards lean clean, data-dense, and efficient. Consumer/marketing sites can be more expressive but should stay coherent and fast. Internal tools prioritize clarity and speed over trendiness.

## 3. Professional Architecture & Code Structure

**Architectures to choose from:**

- **Layered (N-tier)**: UI → application/business logic → data access → DB. Good default for CRMs, line-of-business apps, and most web backends. Keeps concerns separated and testable.
- **Clean / Hexagonal**: Core domain and use cases in the center; adapters for UI, DB, and external APIs. Use when domain logic is complex or you expect multiple UIs or integrations.
- **Feature-based**: Organize by feature (e.g. `auth/`, `orders/`, `reports/`) instead of by layer. Fits well with frontend frameworks and medium-to-large apps; scales better than a single “controllers” folder.
- **Monolith first**: Prefer a well-structured monolith for most products. Split into services only when you have clear boundaries, scaling needs, or team boundaries—not by default.

**Universal practices:**

- **Single responsibility**: One clear purpose per module/class/function.
- **Dependency direction**: Dependencies point inward (e.g. UI and DB depend on domain, not the reverse). Inject dependencies where it improves testability.
- **API contracts**: Version and document public APIs; keep internal implementation flexible.
- **Configuration over hardcoding**: Env-based config for URLs, keys, feature flags; no secrets in code.

For more detail on patterns and folder layouts, see [reference.md](reference.md#architecture-patterns).

## 4. Stacks: When to Use What

**Frontend (websites & web apps):**

- **React + Next.js**: Full-featured apps, SEO, SSR/SSG, API routes. Strong ecosystem and hiring pool. Default choice for many product teams.
- **Vue + Nuxt**: Similar benefits to Next; often preferred for smaller teams or more template-oriented workflows. Great DX.
- **Svelte + SvelteKit**: Less runtime, fast builds, clean syntax. Good for performance-focused or smaller apps.
- **Plain HTML/CSS/JS or minimal tooling**: Marketing sites, simple pages, or when avoiding a framework is a requirement. Use when complexity is low.

**Backend:**

- **Node.js (Express, Fastify)**: Same language as frontend, huge ecosystem. Good for APIs, real-time, and when team is JS/TS-focused.
- **Python (Django, FastAPI)**: Django for CRMs, admin-heavy apps, and rapid delivery. FastAPI for high-performance APIs and async.
- **Go (Fiber, Echo, stdlib)**: Strong for services, CLI tools, and performance-sensitive backends. Smaller ecosystem but fast and simple deploys.
- **C# / .NET**: Enterprise, Windows integration, strong typing. Good fit for existing Microsoft shops and large systems.

**Mobile:**

- **React Native**: Share logic and many components with web React; one team can do web + mobile. Mature ecosystem.
- **Flutter**: Single codebase for iOS/Android; custom rendering, consistent look. Strong for branded UIs and when you are not tied to web reuse.
- **Native (Swift/Kotlin)**: When you need maximum platform leverage, performance, or platform-specific features; higher cost for two codebases.

**Databases:**

- **PostgreSQL**: Default for relational data (CRMs, accounts, transactions). Robust, JSON support, good tooling.
- **SQLite**: Local/single-instance apps, prototypes, embedded. Not for high-concurrency multi-writer.
- **MongoDB / document DBs**: When schema is fluid or document-shaped; use with care for relational or transactional needs.
- **Redis**: Cache, sessions, queues, real-time. Complement to a primary DB.

For comparison tables and edge cases, see [reference.md](reference.md#stacks-and-frameworks).

## 5. Services & Tooling: Backend and App Development

**Backend / BaaS (Backend-as-a-Service):**

- **Supabase**: Open-source Firebase alternative; Postgres, auth, realtime, storage. Good when you want SQL, self-hosting option, and a simple API. Prefer for new projects that need relational data and flexibility.
- **Firebase**: Auth, Firestore, hosting, functions. Strong for rapid prototypes, mobile backends, and when NoSQL and Google ecosystem are a fit. Vendor lock-in and pricing at scale are considerations.
- **Custom backend (Node, Python, Go, etc.)**: Full control, any database, any hosting. Prefer when requirements don’t match BaaS limits or when you need complex logic, compliance, or cost control.

**Auth:**

- **Supabase Auth / Firebase Auth**: Integrated with respective BaaS; quick to ship.
- **Clerk, Auth0, NextAuth**: Dedicated auth services; good for custom backends or when you need many identity providers and enterprise features.
- **Custom (sessions + DB)**: When you need full control or minimal dependencies; more work to secure and maintain.

**Hosting & deployment:**

- **Vercel, Netlify**: Excellent for static and serverless frontends (Next, Nuxt, SvelteKit). Simple CI/CD and previews.
- **Railway, Render, Fly.io**: Good for full-stack apps, databases, and backends; straightforward and cost-effective for small-to-medium.
- **AWS, GCP, Azure**: When you need specific services, compliance, or scale; use only when the complexity is justified.

**When to prefer what:**

- **Speed and simplicity**: Supabase or Firebase + Vercel/Netlify for frontend.
- **Relational data and SQL**: Supabase or custom backend + Postgres.
- **Maximum control and long-term flexibility**: Custom backend + your choice of DB + Railway/Render or cloud.
- **Enterprise or compliance-heavy**: Custom backend + managed DB and auth (e.g. Auth0, Clerk) on a cloud you control.

## 6. Quick Decision Guide

| Goal | Suggestion |
|------|------------|
| Marketing or content site | Static or Next/Nuxt/SvelteKit, Vercel/Netlify |
| Web app with auth and data | Next.js or similar + Supabase, or custom API + Postgres |
| CRM / internal tool | Layered backend (e.g. Django or Node) + Postgres + React/Vue admin or dedicated UI |
| Mobile app + web | React Native + shared API, or Flutter; BaaS or custom API |
| Fast prototype | Next.js + Supabase or Firebase |
| High control, no BaaS | Custom backend (Node/Python/Go) + Postgres + frontend of choice |

## Summary Checklist

When designing or building software:

- [ ] Visual hierarchy, spacing, and typography are consistent and readable
- [ ] Color and motion support clarity and accessibility
- [ ] Architecture matches complexity (layered or feature-based; monolith unless there is a clear reason to split)
- [ ] Stack fits team, product, and constraints (see tables above)
- [ ] Backend and services chosen for data model (relational → Postgres/Supabase or custom) and control needs (BaaS vs custom)
- [ ] Auth and hosting chosen for speed vs control vs compliance
