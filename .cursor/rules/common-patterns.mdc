# Common Patterns

## API Response Format

Use a consistent envelope for API responses:

- Success: `{ success: true, data?: T, meta?: { total, page, limit } }`
- Error: `{ success: false, error: string }`
- Include metadata for paginated responses.

## Repository Pattern

- Encapsulate data access behind a consistent interface.
- Standard operations: findAll, findById, create, update, delete.
- Business logic depends on the interface, not storage details.
- Enables swapping data sources and testing with mocks.

## Skeleton Projects

When adding new functionality: prefer battle-tested patterns, evaluate options (security, extensibility, relevance), then iterate within a clear structure.
