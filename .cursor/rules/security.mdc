# Security Guidelines

## Before Any Commit

- [ ] No hardcoded secrets (API keys, passwords, tokens)
- [ ] All user inputs validated
- [ ] SQL injection prevented (parameterized queries / safe APIs)
- [ ] XSS prevented (sanitized/escaped output)
- [ ] CSRF considered for state-changing requests
- [ ] Auth/authorization verified for protected routes
- [ ] Rate limiting on public endpoints
- [ ] Error messages do not leak sensitive data

## Secrets

- Never hardcode secrets in source.
- Use environment variables or a secret manager.
- Validate required secrets at startup.
- Rotate any secrets that may have been exposed.

## Response

If a security issue is found: stop, fix critical issues, rotate exposed secrets, and review for similar patterns. Use the **security-review** skill for full audits.
