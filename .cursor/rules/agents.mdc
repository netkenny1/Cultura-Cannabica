# Agent Orchestration

## When to Use Which (Conceptual)

| Situation | Use |
|-----------|-----|
| Complex feature or refactor | Planner / plan first |
| Code just written or modified | Code reviewer (self-review or agent) |
| Bug fix or new feature | TDD-style tests where relevant |
| Architecture or API design | Architect perspective |
| Auth, payments, secrets, new APIs | Security reviewer |
| Dead code or cleanup | Refactor/cleaner |
| Docs out of date | Doc updater |

## Parallel Work

For independent tasks, run them in parallel instead of strictly one-by-one (e.g. security pass + performance pass + type-check).

## Multi-Perspective Review

For complex or critical work, consider: factual correctness, code quality, security, consistency, redundancy.
